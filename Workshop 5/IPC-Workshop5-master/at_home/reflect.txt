1) Discuss the advantages of using an array of structs versus parallel arrays when dealing with related
 data.
The advantage of using array of structs is you set the array as struct which makes a collection of
variables in a group and thats easier than doing parallel array because in parralle array you need to
state each type and variable in single line.

2) The preferred method of declaring a struct data type is in a header file. Briefly explain why.

We put struct data in the header because we want to declare the values and variables of the struct
in the first step so we dont have to worry about it in later time and that would be easier to find, also
you will be able to find if there is any problem for it because its in the header before we run the
program first.
