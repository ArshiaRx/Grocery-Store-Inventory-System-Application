1) when passing an array to a function it is by address because that's easier
in later time and you dont need to declare everything again you just giving
the address to it, and we can use pointers to make this step easier for addressing
a function.

2) Functions with an array parameter are usually complemented with an additional 
parameter to show the size and the elements that it can hold to let the function
and statement know about it.S


3) Some of the function "const" been used for array pperameters because they have 
a constant value and dont need to be changed in later time and thats why we declare 
the value as const in the first place.

Thank you
