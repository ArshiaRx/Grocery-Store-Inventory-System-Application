1) The advantage of passing the value through function is that it's

much easier and it will help you to hold the value in the function prameter 

and wont get anyone confused.

2) Dereference is to access the things to a pointer points which lets

you declares integer by pointers and also lets to address them in later

functions. Ex: int p* = &i

3) What is stored in pointer variable is the integers and the address

of that file which lets you transfer the value of that specific

variable to another integers in later functions and statements.

Thank you
