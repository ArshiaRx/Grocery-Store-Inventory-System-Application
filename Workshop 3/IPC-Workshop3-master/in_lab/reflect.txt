Workshop 3 - Reflect

1) Name all the iteration constructs?

- while

- do while 

- For

2) Explain the difference between a "do while" and a "while"

loop?

The difference between "while" and "do while" is that in 

"while" the construct executes its sequence as long as the 

test condition is true but in "do while" the construct 

executes its sequence at least one and continues executing 

as long as the test condition is true.

3) What is a conditional expression?

The conditional selection constructs is shorthand for the

alternative path construct. This ternary expression 

combines the condition and two sub-expressions using? :

operator

If the condition is true, the expression evalutes to the 

operand between ? and : . If the condirtion is false the,

expression evalutes to the operand. If the operands in a 

conditional expression are themselves expressions, the
 
conditonal expression only evalutes the operand identified 

by the condition.
