1- Function is basically when the program transfer a contorl bettween 
one another. When this control is transfered to another function we 
say that it calls the other function. A function needs a type function
and return value, function identifier also it need parenthese-enclosed list
that receive from caller.

2- We called each function twice like the porotype and implement and 
thats because in one function we declare it and in other function
we give the calculation if is needed for example in addpositive we
let the program know that for that specific identifier it have to 
claculate something with other thing and give the answer by that 
identifier. Same with subtractPositive.

3- We send and recieve data from function calling for example we 
say main(void) with a parenthese which at the end which
we say return 0; with a parenthese-enclosed.

Done :)
